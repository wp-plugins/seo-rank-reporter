While traffic is a good measurement of SEO, online marketers who take their SEO seriously, will also use rankings as a major KPI (key performance indicator) of their work. Many SEO tools exist to track Google rankings. However, these tools can be pricey and bulky. 

The SEO Rank Reporter tool was built to offer a simple ranking measurement tool for Wordpress websites. Users can now view how their website ranks for a number of different keywords right within their Wordpress admin panel.
